        <p align="left">If you previously did some waypoints for POD-Bot you will 
          notice some<br>
          differences. First, you are now allowed to have connections between<br>
          8 Waypoints at the same time (was 4 before). Also the Wayzone Radius<br>
          gets calculated instantly now when placing a waypoint (makes &quot;<b>wayzone<br>
          calcall</b>&quot; somewhat obsolete). And even more important you should 
          now do<br>
          lots of waypoints since the Bots will try to to vary them. Also try 
          to<br>
          place waypoints at Places where you would like them to take cover (see<br>
          below for a more lengthy explanation).</p>
        <hr>
        <p align="left">First, before starting to do waypoints because you desperately 
          need them for a custom map you want to play you better check here if 
          they weren't already done by someone else:<br>
          <a href="http://www.nuclearbox.com/podbot/downloads.shtml">http://www.nuclearbox.com/podbot/downloads.shtml</a></p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          <b>1. Waypoints, what are they ?</b></p>
        <p align="left">Waypoints are locations in the maps that the bots will 
          use when navigating.<br>
          They allow the bot to roam about the map without having to blindly bump 
          into<br>
          walls. Waypoints can be thought of like the bread crumbs in the Hansel 
          and<br>
          Gretel story. They are something marking a path to make it easier to 
          follow.<br>
          The waypoints are not displayed while the game is being played. The 
          bots<br>
          &quot;know&quot; which way to go by following the path laid out by these 
          waypoints.</p>
        <p align="left">In order to get the bots to cover the entire map when 
          playing the game,<br>
          waypoints should be laid out all over the map. Without the waypoints 
          the<br>
          bots will just randomly run around and will tend to stay in the same 
          area.<br>
          Waypoints also allow the bot to know where specific goals are in the 
          game.<br>
          You couldn't play capture the flag unless you knew where the flag was 
          and<br>
          where the flag needed to be taken after being captured. Waypoints are 
          what<br>
          makes all of these things possible. Bots with sufficiently advanced 
          waypoint<br>
          information and algorithms would be able to find the shortest distance<br>
          between points in the map and navigate from their current position to 
          some<br>
          goal on the other side of the map.</p>
        <p align="left">This document describes the commands needed to create 
          or edit a waypoint<br>
          file (to be used with POD-Bot). When creating or editing a waypoint<br>
          file it is best <b>NOT</b> to have any bots wandering around at the 
          same time.<br>
          Create a LAN game, and join the game then start laying out waypoints 
          for<br>
          a map. Save the waypoint file, disconnect from the server, then start 
          the<br>
          game again, this time with the bots to see how well (or poorly) they 
          follow<br>
          the waypoints you have created.</p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          <b>2. What do waypoints look like in the map ?</b></p>
        <p align="left">The waypoints are displayed using vertical lines that 
          look like lightning or<br>
          electric streams. The vertical line used to draw the waypoint is the 
          same<br>
          height as the player. The point in space at the center of this vertical 
          line<br>
          is what is actually used as the waypoint. Different Types of waypoints 
          have<br>
          different colors. </p>
        <p align="left">Waypoints are stored in a file with the same name as the 
          map file name but<br>
          using the extension &quot;<b>.pwf</b>&quot; instead of the map file 
          extension of &quot;<b>.bsp</b>&quot;. For<br>
          example, the waypoint file for the map de_dust would be de_dust.pwf.It 
          will be<br>
          stored in the Half-Life\cstrike\PODBot folder and then in the folder 
          you specified<br>
          with wptfolder (defaults to &quot;<b>WPTDefault</b>&quot;).<br>
          Waypoint files are automatically loaded when the map is loaded (if they<br>
          exist). If the waypoint file does not exist, you will need to create 
          it<br>
          using the directions contained in this document.</p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          <b>3. Waypoint console commands Summary</b></p>
        <p align="left">The following Waypoint commands are available (note these 
          ARE case sensitive):</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>waypoint on</b>&quot; - Turns on displaying of 
          waypoints.<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint on noclip</b>&quot; - Turns on waypoint editing with 
          noclip cheat. This allows you<br>
          to fly and you don't collide with walls. Useful for doing swim waypoints.<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint off</b>&quot; - Turns off displaying of all waypoints.<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint add</b>&quot; - Adds a waypoint at the current player 
          location. A Menu will pop<br>
          up where you have to select the different types of waypoints<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint delete</b>&quot; - Deletes the waypoint nearest to 
          the player (see below).<br>
          <b>&quot;waypoint find x&quot;</b> - Shows you the Direction to a specific 
          Waypoint Nr. x<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint showflags</b>&quot; - Shows all of the Flags which 
          are set manually on this waypoint<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint addflag</b>&quot; - Allows you to manually add Flags 
          to a waypoint. <br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint delflag</b>&quot; - Let's you select a waypoint flag 
          to delete<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint setradius x</b>&quot; - Manually sets the Wayzone 
          Radius for this waypoint to<br>
          Value x <br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint stats</b>&quot; - Shows the number of different waypoints 
          you did already set.<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint check</b>&quot; - Checks if all Waypoints are valid 
          (automatically done when saving them too)<br>
          &quot;<b>wayzone calcall</b>&quot; - Calculates the Wayzone Radius for 
          all Waypoints in the Map. (obsolete now since V1.3 because wayzones 
          are automatically set when a waypoint is created)<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint save</b>&quot; - Saves the current waypoint list to 
          a file (with Waypoint &amp; Path Checking)<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint save nocheck</b>&quot; - Same as above but forcing 
          tosave even if they are full of errors..<br>
          &quot;<b>waypoint load</b>&quot; - Loads the waypoint list from a waypoint 
          file (and initialises all Datas).<br>
          <br>
          &quot;<b>autowaypoint</b>&quot; - Displays the status of the autowaypoint 
          setting.<br>
          &quot;<b>autowaypoint on</b>&quot; - Turns on autowaypoint setting.<br>
          &quot;<b>autowaypoint off</b>&quot; - Turns off autowaypoint setting.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>pathwaypoint</b>&quot; - Displays the status 
          of the pathwaypoint setting.<br>
          &quot;<b>pathwaypoint on</b>&quot; - Turns on the pathwaypoint setting 
          (see below).<br>
          &quot;<b>pathwaypoint off</b>&quot; - Turns off the pathwaypoint setting.<br>
          &quot;<b>pathwaypoint add x</b>&quot; - Connects the nearest Waypoint 
          to you, with the<br>
          waypoint whose number specified with Value x.<br>
          &quot;<b>pathwaypoint delete x</b>&quot; - Disconnects the nearest Waypoint 
          to you, with the<br>
          waypoint whose number specified with Value x.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><b>&quot;debuggoal x</b>&quot; - Forces Bots to use Waypoint 
          Nr. x as a Destination Waypoint </p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          To use the waypoint commands, you will have to use the console. You 
          must<br>
          start the game with the console option enabled (use &quot;<b>hl.exe 
          -console</b>&quot; in<br>
          the Target: line of a shortcut or use &quot;Half-Life Console&quot; 
          in your SIERRA<br>
          menu from the Windows Start button). Use the '~' key to bring down the<br>
          console. Enter the console commands that you wish, then use the '~' 
          key<br>
          again to return to the game.</p>
        <p align="left">You can make things easier by binding console commands 
          to keys on the<br>
          keyboard. Just type &quot;bind&quot; followed by the key you want to 
          bind to,<br>
          followed by the console command. You will have to use double quotes<br>
          on the console command if it's more than one word. Here's an example<br>
          of console commands that I use when editing waypoints...</p>
        <p align="left"><b>bind a &quot;waypoint add&quot;</b><br>
          <b>bind d &quot;waypoint delete&quot;</b><br>
          <b>bind l &quot;waypoint load&quot;</b><br>
          <b>bind w &quot;waypoint save&quot;</b></p>
        <p align="left">The 'a' key will manually add a waypoint. The 'd' key 
          will delete a waypoint.<br>
          The 'l' key will load the most recently saved waypoint file (useful 
          if you<br>
          have added some waypoints but don't want to save them and want to go 
          back to<br>
          the previously save waypoint list, sort of like an &quot;undo&quot;). 
          The 'w' key (for<br>
          &quot;write waypoints&quot;) will save the list of waypoints to the 
          waypoint file. I<br>
          tried using 's' (for &quot;save waypoints&quot;), but I kept hitting 
          's' by mistake when<br>
          I wanted to add or delete a waypoint.</p>
        <p align="left">Using &quot;<b>waypoint add</b>&quot; will place a waypoint 
          at the location that the player is<br>
          currently at in a map. Waypoints can be placed anywhere the player can 
          go.<br>
          When placing a waypoint, you will hear a sound to indicate that the 
          waypoint has been dropped (the sound is the same sound the crossbow 
          bolt makes when striking an wall).<br>
          You then have to specify the Type of waypoint you want to place here.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>Normal Waypoint</b>&quot; sets a Waypoint which 
          is used for normal walking from one<br>
          point to each other. From V1.4 on you should place lots of them (but 
          still caring for some distance between them), since the<br>
          Bots use them for hiding and varying their paths. Color is green.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="GFX/normal.JPG" width="320" height="240" name="NormalWaypoint"><br>
          <b>A Standard Normal Waypoint</b></p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>Terrorist Important Waypoint</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Counter 
          Important Waypoint</b>&quot;<br>
          These are strategical waypoints for that team. Bots use these waypoints<br>
          to patrol the map. How they use this, heavily depends on the map type.<br>
          In a DE Map you should place a lot of Counter Waypoints around the<br>
          Bomb Plant Zone and only 2 or 3 strategical waypoints for Terrorists.<br>
          On a DE Map Counter Bots will most of the time pick a Counter Waypoint 
          as<br>
          a destination and only sometimes pick a Terrorist waypoint. Terrorists<br>
          are allowed to pick any of them as a goal waypoint. This behaviour changes<br>
          with the maptype, in a CS map for example it is vice versa.<br>
          It helps to think of the important waypoints like strategical positions 
          in a sports game. Imagine the team which defends the Map Goal is the 
          'Home Team' and the other one is the 'Away Team'. Now you need to have 
          more important waypoints for the Home Team, because the Away Team will 
          go for them anyway. On a DE Map the CT Team is the Home Team, on a CS 
          &amp; AS Map the Terrorist Team is the Home Team. The average number 
          of 'Home Team' Important Waypoints should be about twice as much as 
          the the important waypoints for the 'Away Team'. Terrorists WP Color 
          is red, Counter Waypoints<br>
          are blue. </p>

        <p align="left"> &quot;<b>Ladder Waypoint</b>&quot;<br>
          These need to be placed on a ladder if you want the Bots to climb it.<br>
          Set the bottom waypoint at a position where you're already &quot;stuck&quot; 
          to the<br>
          ladder. At the top of the ladder you should place another ladder waypoint.<br>
          Set this at a position where you can hardly look ever the edge. If the 
          ladder<br>
          is quite a long one, you might want to place another ladder waypoint 
          in<br>
          between the other ones. In most cases you need to connect the waypoints<br>
          manually by using pathwaypoint (see below). If there is no connection<br>
          between the waypoints the Bots won't climb the ladder ! Color is purple.</p>

          <b>A ladder waypoint<br>
          </b> </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>Rescue Waypoint</b>&quot;<br>
          This is only needed on Hostage Maps. It's the location where you want<br>
          the CT Bots to rescue the hostages. Usually only 1 is needed (depending 
          on how much Rescue Zones there are it might be more).. Color is white.</p>

          In DE<br>
          maps this is a bomb plant spot and on cs maps Counter look here to rescue<br>
          some hostages. In AS maps these are the Escape points for the VIP. Color 
          is<br>
          purple like ladder waypoints.</p>

          <b>A Goal Waypoin</b>t</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>Campstart Waypoint</b>&quot;<br>
          This is a camping (or sniper if you prefer) waypoint. To place it, look 
          into<br>
          the direction you want the Bot to start looking at when camping. To 
          let him<br>
          crouch at that position just press the duck button while adding it. 
          You also<br>
          need to specify the:<br>
          &quot;<b>Campend Waypoint</b>&quot;<br>
          Selecting this will set the end direction for the Bot to look at when 
          camping.<br>
          Look straight into the direction where you want the Bot to look and 
          select it.<br>
          Note: you can't set a campend waypoint before doing a campstart waypoint.<br>
          Normal Color is cyan, if you made it team specific it will have a touch 
          of red<br>
          if Terrorist WPT or blue if CT.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="GFX/camp.JPG" width="320" height="240" name="CampWaypoint"><br>

          </b>This is the very first of the upcoming learning Features in POD 
          (I'm planning on extending this a lot). By selecting it, your moves 
          will be monitored and if you jump, a normal waypoint will be placed 
          at the position you started to jump and another will be placed where 
          you landed. The Waypoint Type as said before is a standard waypoint 
          but a red connection line will show you that there is a jump connection 
          between the two. You can also create jump connections between already 
          existing waypoints, just make sure you're in the near of the first when 
          jumping and land in the near of the destination waypoint. Note that 
          this will adjust the waypoints origin on the average position of the 
          previous position and your jump position. You can even have the Bots 
          jump to a ladder or do several jumps after each other !</p>

        <p align="left"><b>*NOTE*</b><br>
          To set a <b>crouch waypoint</b>, just keep holding your duck key. You 
          certainly<br>
          noticed, I don't have different paths for different teams. I removed 
          team<br>
          specific paths, since the Bots should be free (IMHO) to walk everywhere 
          and<br>
          I secretly hated to to do waypoints for every team.<br>
          <br>
          Using &quot;<b>waypoint delete</b>&quot; will remove the waypoint closest 
          to the player. The<br>
          waypoint MUST be within 40 units from the player (about 1/2 the player 
          height)<br>
          in order to be removed. You will need to stand fairly close to the waypoint<br>
          to be able to remove it. This prevents you from accidentally removing 
          a<br>
          waypoint on the other side of the room. When removing a waypoint you 
          will<br>
          hear a sound indicating that the waypoint was removed (the same sound 
          the<br>
          tripmine makes when placed on a wall).</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;<b>waypoint addflag/deleteflag</b>&quot; gives you 
          some additional options for waypoints.<br>
          The first, &quot;<b>blockwithhostage</b>&quot; is rarely used. If you 
          set this flag on a<br>
          waypoint Bots won't take this waypoint if a hostage is following them.<br>
          With the other two, you can make a campwaypoint team-specific.</p>
        <p align="left">Using &quot;<b>waypoint save</b>&quot; will save the waypoint 
          data to the waypoint file. Before saving (if you didn't add the 'nocheck' 
          argument, the Waypoints and Paths will be checked for major mistakes 
          and if something is wrong you'll be told so and nothing will be saved. 
          During the checking time CS freezes and depending on the speed of your 
          computer it could easily last for a minute. Don't worry your computer 
          hasn't crashed ! <br>
          Waypoint files will have the same name as the current map with an extension<br>
          of &quot;.pwf&quot;. The file will be saved into the &quot;cstrike/PODBot&quot; 
          Folder. Your<br>
          current player name will be saved as the waypoint file creator.</p>
        <p align="left">Using &quot;<b>waypoint load</b>&quot; will clear out 
          all waypoints in the current map and<br>
          load them from the waypoint file in the maps folder. This is a good 
          way<br>
          to &quot;undo&quot; a bunch of waypoints that you have created but do 
          not wish to<br>
          save. There is no way to &quot;undo&quot; a single waypoint. You will 
          have to use<br>
          the &quot;<b>waypoint delete</b>&quot; command to remove waypoints one-by-one.</p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          The &quot;<b>autowaypoint</b>&quot; command allows you to automatically 
          drop waypoints as<br>
          you run around in a map. To turn autowaypointing on use &quot;<b>autowaypoint 
          on</b>&quot;.<br>
          As you run around the level waypoints will be dropped every 200 units<br>
          automatically. No waypoint will be dropped if another waypoint is already<br>
          within 200 units of your current position. So if you want to place lots<br>
          of waypoints fairly close together you may have to manually place some 
          of<br>
          the waypoints using the &quot;<b>waypoint add</b>&quot; command. Autowaypointing 
          keeps<br>
          track of where the last waypoint was dropped (either manually or from<br>
          autowaypointing) and will place another waypoint when you are 200 units<br>
          from the last waypoint. If you don't like where autowaypointing placed<br>
          a waypoint and want to move it a little bit, you can delete the waypoint<br>
          using &quot;waypoint delete&quot; (but turn off autowaypointing before, 
          since it<br>
          will place a new waypoint otherwise). </p>
        <p align="left">When using autowaypointing, try to stay in the center 
          of narrow hallways<br>
          and always place a waypoint on BOTH sides of a door. You may have to 
          place<br>
          some of these waypoints manually using &quot;<b>waypoint add</b>&quot; 
          since places like<br>
          intersections of hallways and doorway entrances and exits don't usually<br>
          fall exactly at the location where autowaypoint would want to place 
          a<br>
          waypoint.<br>
          <b>Don't use autowaypointing for locations like ladders or jumps !</b></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The &quot;<b>pathwaypoint</b>&quot; command allows you 
          to display what the bots would consider<br>
          to be a valid path from one waypoint to other waypoints. Turn pathwaypoint<br>
          on using &quot;<b>pathwaypoint on</b>&quot; and whenever you get close 
          to a waypoint<br>
          yellow or white lines will be drawn to all of the other waypoints that 
          the bot<br>
          would consider to be &quot;reachable&quot;. If the connection is a two-way 
          connection the<br>
          line is yellow, one-way connections appear white. These &quot;reachable&quot; 
          waypoints<br>
          would be waypoints that are clearly visible from the current location. 
          Certain<br>
          waypoints will be disallowed as reachable for one reason or another. 
          For<br>
          example, waypoints suspended in mid-air above the bot would not be considered<br>
          reachable since the bot couldn't jump high enough to get to them. Also<br>
          waypoints that are too far away from the current location would not 
          be<br>
          considered reachable. You may have waypoints that are close enough to 
          each<br>
          other, but across a wide gap that would be too wide to jump. If the 
          far<br>
          waypoint is close enough and clearly visible, it would still show as<br>
          &quot;reachable&quot; since I currently don't have a method to determine 
          if the bot<br>
          can get to that waypoint or not.</p>
        <p align="left">The bots will <b>ONLY</b> move from one waypoint to another 
          if there is a path between<br>
          them. Get in the habit of turning on the pathwaypoint setting when creating<br>
          waypoint files so that you can see the waypoint paths and will know 
          whether<br>
          or not a path exists between two waypoints. Also get in the habit of 
          checking<br>
          that paths exist <b>BOTH WAYS</b> between waypoints. Just because a 
          path is drawn<br>
          from point A to point B, doesn't mean that a path exists from point 
          B to<br>
          point A.</p>
        <p align="left">The &quot;<b>pathwaypoint add &lt;waypointnr&gt;</b>&quot; 
          command allows you to<br>
          manually assign a path between 2 waypoints. This is needed in some cases<br>
          where the waypoints are blocked (by doorways or other objects) and you 
          wish<br>
          to create a path between these waypoints. Also ladder waypoints need 
          to be<br>
          manually connected most of the time. Move close to the waypoint you<br>
          wish the path to start from and use the &quot;<b>pathwaypoint add x</b>&quot; 
          command.<br>
          Of course the &quot;x&quot; must be replaced by a valid waypoint number. 
          The actual<br>
          Waypoint Number you're standing on, will be shown in the upper corner 
          of your<br>
          HUD (if you turned pathwaypoint on).<br>
          For example to manually assign a path between Waypoint Nr. 250 and 251,<br>
          you first should stand in the near of Waypoint Nr. 250. Then type in:<br>
          &quot;pathwaypoint add 251&quot; and it will get connected. <br>
          You should now see a white waypoint path<br>
          line being draw from the start waypoint to the end waypoint. Note that 
          this<br>
          is a <b>ONE-WAY</b> connection. If you wish to create a path back in 
          the other<br>
          direction you will have to start with the second waypoint and end the 
          path<br>
          back at the first waypoint.</p>

        <p align="center"><b>A 2-Way Connection</b></p>
        <p align="left">The &quot;<b>pathwaypoint delete x</b>&quot; command is 
          just like<br>
          the &quot;add&quot; command except that it removes a path (connection) 
          from the<br>
          starting point to the ending point. This is necessary in some cases 
          where<br>
          you may have a door that opens from one side and allows you to go through<br>
          but once the door closes you can't go back through the other way.</p>
        <p align="left">When adding waypoints use the pathwaypoint feature to 
          verify that waypoints<br>
          are actually reachable. Sometimes you add a waypoint and it appears 
          close<br>
          enough and it also appears to be in plain sight, but the Half-Life engine<br>
          doesn't indicate that the waypoint is &quot;reachable&quot;. <br>
          Be sure to check this in <b>BOTH</b> directions when defining a waypoint 
          path.<br>
          Usually you don't have to be too careful about waypoint<br>
          placement, but in some situations, you may have to spend more time carefully<br>
          laying out waypoints to get them to be &quot;reachable&quot; (ladders 
          are a good<br>
          example).</p>
        <p align="left">To set crouch waypoints, simply crouch when adding the 
          waypoint. You will<br>
          notice that the waypoint line is shorter than a normal waypoint. Bot 
          will<br>
          crouch automatically when approaching a crouch waypoint (if it's not 
          a<br>
          camping waypoint).</p>
        <p align="left">Try placing waypoints at intersections in hallways (do 
          use some <br>
          &quot;important&quot; waypoints at crossings). Try not to place waypoints 
          in<br>
          places where the bots would bump into corners of walls or other obstacles<br>
          when trying to get from one waypoint to the next. Remember the bots 
          won't<br>
          always take what you consider to be the &quot;obvious&quot; choice when 
          choosing the<br>
          next waypoint. Try to limit the choices that they have to keep them 
          from<br>
          heading off in the wrong direction. Also remember that the Bots could 
          go<br>
          backward in a fight and might not find a waypoint. In that special case<br>
          they wouldn't find a near enough waypoint (they only search in-between<br>
          200 Units) and get stuck forever. Since V1.4 it's important to have 
          a lot<br>
          of waypoints together to allow the Bots a wider choice. Also put some<br>
          waypoints in corners or behind walls/doors so they can take good cover<br>
          positions. The Bots will try to take cover at waypoints</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>not seen by the enemy and</b></li>
            <li><b> the one with the smallest wayzone radius in their range</b>

        </div>
        <p align="left"><b>4. What are the Wayzones ?</b></p>
        <p align="left">Bots will pick a point inside this radius for their destination 
          origin (based<br>
          on things like orientation etc.), this just makes movement not that 
          &quot;static&quot;.<br>
          Ladder waypoints, camp waypoints and goal waypoints will always have 
          a radius<br>
          of 0. Don't try to change it ! After POD-Bot calculated all Zones you 
          should<br>
          walk all over your waypoints to verify that they are reachable within 
          their<br>
          radius. Try to be careful with the radius. If your path bends around 
          corners<br>
          it's better to lower the radius. You should set the radius to 0 if the 
          Path<br>
          goes through some narrow doorways or similar. You manually assign a 
          new value<br>
          by standing near to the waypoint and typing &quot;<b>waypoint setradius 
          x</b>&quot;. Where x<br>
          is the value you want to assign. Valid ranges are 0-128. The bigger, 
          the wider<br>
          it is. You'll also notice, if you turned on pathwaypointing some lines 
          will<br>
          show you the radius of the actual waypoint (if it's not 0).</p>

        <p align="left"><i>Some Tips &amp; Tricks when creating waypoints:</i><br>
          I start by typing &quot;<b>waypoint on</b>&quot;. After that I type 
          &quot;<b>autowaypoint on</b>&quot; and<br>
          &quot;<b>pathwaypoint on</b>&quot;. Then I try to cover the map with 
          waypoints everywhere<br>
          I want the Bots to roam (except for ladder waypoints) and manually adjust 
          wayzone radii which aren't appropriate . After this I try to think of 
          the important points for each team. I move to that position, delete 
          the &quot;normal&quot; waypoint and instead set a strategical waypoint 
          at that position. Then I place the goal waypoints, rescue waypoints 
          (if needed) and ladder waypoints. Then I do a lot of test playing and 
          checking with 'debuggoal' until I'm finally satisfied with all of the 
          movement.<br>
          When saving and there are errors, the waypoint number with the error 
          will be shown to you. Use 'waypoint find x' where x is the number of 
          the waypoint you want to find. Green Beams will then show you the direction 
          to the waypoint <b>if you previously turned on pathwaypoints</b>. Type 
          'waypoint find -1' to turn it off. Another useful command for testing 
          waypoints is the debuggoal command. If you want to check out if Bots 
          will make it through a difficult route, save the waypoints, then load 
          them again and type debuggoal x, where x is again the number of the 
          waypoint. you want the Bot to reach. After that add 1 Bot to your team 
          and watch him move to that waypoint. Be sure to turn it off again for 
          real playing because otherwise all of the Bots would take this waypoint 
          as a goal.<br>
          There's no waypoint for shooting breakables. The Bots will automatically 
          shoot them if it's blocking their way, just make sure that the path 
          connection goes right through the breakable. There's also no button 
          waypoint. If a Bot sees a Button he will randomly try to press it. If 
          you want to make sure that the Bot uses the Button you could do tricky 
          waypoint connections leading towards the button.</p>

        <h3 align="left">Some common newbie mistakes:</h3>
        <h4 align="left">Picture 1 - Placing unnecessary waypoints</h4>
        <h4 align="left"><img src="GFX/mistake1.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>The waypoint in the middle of the window was probably set with the 
          intention to help the Bot with navigating through it. However it results 
          in the opposite. If the Bots have a clear Line of Sight to another waypoint 
          they assume there won't be any obstacle in the way. It would be better 
          to delete the waypoint in the window and just connect the waypoint in 
          front of the window with the one behind it.</p>
        <h4>Picture 2 - not fitting Wayzones</h4>
        <h4><br>
          <img src="GFX/mistake2.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>Look at that biiig wayzone assigned to this waypoint. If a Bot tries 
          to walk over this foot-bridge he will almost 100% fall down into death 
          because he would think even the free space beside it is walkable. For 
          precise movement a wayzone radius of 0 should be assigned instead.</p>
        <h4>Picture 3 - No connections between Waypoints, bad ladder waypoints</h4>
        <h4><img src="GFX/mistake3.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>First, the connection from the normal waypoint isn't the best. It is 
          better to have the angle of approach set in a more straight angle. But 
          the really bad error is that there's probably no connection from the 
          ladder waypoint to the normal waypoint above. Let's take a look down 
          from the upper waypoint:<br>
          <img src="GFX/mistake3_1.JPG" width="320" height="240"></p>
        <p>Yes. It's even worse. There's a one-way connection from the upper waypoint 
          to the ladder waypoint (at an angle where the Bot won't use the ladder 
          resulting in broken legs), there's no connection from the ladder waypoint 
          to the top and worst of all would be the only Path Bots could take to 
          reach this position. Playing with such waypoints would result in Bots 
          circling around a single waypoint just because the waypointer forgot 
          about connecting them. Simply manually connecting the ladder waypoint 
          with the top waypoint would get rid of the problem.</p>
        <h4>Picture 4 - Wrong Placement of Important Waypoints</h4>
        <h4><img src="GFX/mistake4.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>Now look at this. Isn't it funny how peacefully the Terrorist Important 
          Waypoint, the CT Important Waypoint and the Normal Waypoint co-exist 
          at the same place ? <b>NO, it's not!<br>
          </b>This map - cs_galleon - is a hostage map where the Terrorist Team 
          starts on the ship and the Counter-Terrorists Team spawn somewhere else 
          outside the ship. Having both of the Important Points at the same place 
          screws up all tactical reasoning the Bots do and will just result in 
          Deathmatch Gameplay (if there even will be gameplay then). So the CT 
          Important Waypoint should be deleted and be recreated at the CT Spawn 
          Area or in the near of it. In addition the CT Waypoint and the normal 
          waypoint are much to close together. More about this below...<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Picture 5 - Bad approach angles for Ladder Waypoints</h4>
        <h4><img src="GFX/mistake5.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>The normal waypoint in the front is connected with the ladder waypoint 
          in the background at an angle that the Bots will almost everytime run 
          either into the back of the ladder or collide with the side of it. To 
          make it even worse the normal waypoint on the right is also connected 
          with the ladder waypoint (you can't see it on the picture) so the Bots 
          will get stuck everytime they want to use the ladder (they don't know 
          how to manoever around backsides of ladders).. Luckily there is a button 
          at the left of the picture so if the Bot heads off to press it, there's 
          a chance he will approach the ladder from a better side. The problem 
          could easily be solved by deleting the connection from the waypoint 
          on the right side to the ladder and by moving the front waypoint a short 
          distance to the left.</p>
        <h4>Picture 6 - Waypoints too close together</h4>
        <h4><img src="GFX/mistake6.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>Besides that two waypoints at this close distance are absolutely unnecessary, 
          it will slow down the Bot (because of the higher amount of waypoints) 
          and furthermore will do no good to the Bots Navigation and Collision 
          Avoidance. I'll try to explain:</p>
        <p>The Bots have a hardcoded radius inside my DLL where the Bot thinks 
          he reached this precious waypoints. It differs between types of waypoints, 
          to stay at the example picture normal waypoints are considered to be 
          reached when the Bot is inside a radius of 50 Units from the center 
          of the waypoint. To see what I mean with 50 Units you could set a waypoint 
          to a 50 Unit Wayzone by typing 'wayzone setradius 50'. Now in the example 
          picture the distance between the 2 waypoints is way below it, at a rough 
          guess I would say 16 Units. So what ? If the Bot reaches Waypoint Nr. 
          1, he automatically thinks (in the same frame) he has reached Waypoint 
          Nr. 2 without any movement which obviously is bad for precise movement. 
          Furthermore I'm post-processing the paths of the Bots so when 2 Bots 
          have the same waypoint as a goal I try to find alternative waypoints. 
          So if a colliding Bot #1 wants to reach Waypoint Nr. 1, Waypoint Nr. 
          2 will be a assigned to Bot #2 which leads to the Bots getting stuck 
          in each other very often. Avoid something like this at all costs!</p>
        <h4>Picture 7 - No Waypoints at all !</h4>
        <h4><br>
          <img src="GFX/mistake7.JPG" width="320" height="240"></h4>
        <p>I can imagine looking at this scenario that the waypointer thought 
          something like this: &quot;Oh well, these Bots are waypointed and I 
          don't want them to move here so I just don't set waypoints here and 
          everything's fine&quot;. <b>This is wrong! </b>It's true that POD-Bot 
          uses waypoints for basic movement so the Bots normally should never 
          reach this position in their normal navigation. But it's totally different 
          when engaged in combat ! If a Bot is attacking/fleeing an enemy he doesn't 
          use waypoints but uses an unwaypointed navigation like Realbot for example. 
          So it could easily be the case that a Bot is engaged at a position where 
          waypoints are available, moves backwards while fighting the enemy, finally 
          kills his enemy and stands at the position where I took the screenshot. 
          Now the Bot wants to switch back to waypointed movement but can't find 
          a waypoint in the near distance and is stuck forever again. So a basic 
          rule would be to place waypoints even in areas where you doubt a Bot 
          will ever move to, you never know what could happen in combat! </p>

        <p align="left"> Phew ! I hope I didn't miss anything. Remember: the better 
          the waypoint file,<br>
          the more fun it is to play with the Bots ! If they are stuck somewhere
