          This Bot has been started based on code from the Half-Life HPB-Bot by 
          Botman. It has evolved over the time and this is the result...anyway, 
          thanks again Botman !</p>

          <li> BotChatTurkish.txt </li>
        </ul>
        <p>all located in the Podbot\Botchats Folder where you installed the Bot. 
          Rename and copy one of these to &quot;<b>botchat.txt</b>&quot; in the 
          main podbot folder to have your localized Bot Talk...<br>
          Note that the translated versions (except the german &amp; english ones) 
          don't use the new Text replacements and the dynamic keyword chat is 
          still in english language.</p>
        <p> Also located in the main folder is a File called <b>botskill.cfg</b> 
          were you can tweak most skill<br>
          settings for the Bots if you find them too easy/too hard, to change 
          the Names Bots use just edit <b>Botnames.txt</b> and some useful settings 
          can be changed in <b>podbot.cfg</b>.<br>
        </p>
        <p><i>Now you're ready to play!</i></p>
        <h4><br>
          Removing the Bot from your system (Windows)</h4>
        <p>Just use the 'Remove POD-Bot' ShortCut in your Start-Menu. After that 
          you have to rename the file 'csold.gam' to 'liblist.gam' in your cstrike 
          Game Folder to have a full working CS again.</p>
        <h3><br>
          How to start a Game with Bots:</h3>
        <p>Create a Game with a map that has waypoints for POD-Bot (take a look 
          into<br>
          the &quot;cstrike\podbot\WPTDefault&quot; folder - all files with the 
          extension &quot;.pwf&quot;<br>
          should be valid waypoint files. <br>
          Bots will automatically be added to the game using the &quot;podbot.cfg&quot; 
          file found<br>
          in the /cstrike/podbot directory. If you wish to change the number of 
          bots<br>
          that are created automatically you can edit the <b>podbot.cfg</b> file 
          using any text editor.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Since V1.4 a helpful User Menu is available for performing the most 
          used actions.<br>
          It's bound by default (you can change it in <b>podbot.cfg</b>) to the 
          &quot;=&quot; key. If you're<br>
          pressing the &quot;=&quot; key a Menu with the following options should 
          appear on your Screen:</p>
        <p><b>1. Quick Add Bot</b></p>
        <p>This does what it says. It quickly adds a Bot giving him a random name, 
          team, skill<br>
          and model. Skill will be chosen randomly between your minbotskill/maxbotskill 
          values specified in <b>podbot.cfg</b>..</p>
        <p><b>2. Add specific Bot</b></p>
        <p>Allows you specify all things for adding a single Bot.</p>
        <p><b>3. Kill all Bots</b></p>
        <p>Kills all Bots in all Teams. You can use this to end Rounds faster 
          if there aren't any humans alive and you don't like watching Bots playing 
          better than you :)</p>
        <p><b>4. Newround</b></p>
        <p>Same as above, but kills every Client including human players.</p>
        <p><b>5. Fill Server with Bots</b></p>
        <p>Fills all free Server Entries with Bots. After selecting this option 
          you can specify the team or to auto-assign them. If you especially select 
          a team for the Bots the Server Variables &quot;mp_autoteambalance&quot; 
          and &quot;mp_limitteams&quot; will be set to 0 (thus not caring about 
          balancing teams anymore) and all Bots will only join 1 Team. You can 
          use for example this to play alone or with your friends against all 
          Bots.</p>
        <p><b>6. Kick Random Bot</b></p>
        <p>Kicks the first Bot in the List.</p>
        <p><b>7. Remove all Bots</b></p>
        <p>Kicks all Bots off the Server.</p>
        <p><b>8. Select Weapon Mode</b></p>
        <p>Opens another Sub-Menu where you can select the Weapons Bots will buy 
          (and use in combat). Selecting Knife Mode will also turn on Jason-Mode. 
          Selecting Standard Weapons will turn it off again.</p>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Using Commands besides the in-game menu (using the console):</h4>
        <p>If a map has loaded, press the key below &quot;Esc&quot; (the ~ key) 
          and the console screen scrolls down. Now you're able to type in commands 
          like the ones used to control POD-Bot.</p>
        <p>Some examples:<br>
          Just type &quot;<b>addbot</b>&quot; and a new Bot will be connected... 
          <br>
          If the Bots are stuck or you just want to start a new round type in<br>
          &quot;<b>killbots</b>&quot; which will force all bots to be dead instantly. 
          If you're sick of<br>
          playing with Bots type &quot;<b>removebots</b>&quot; which will kick 
          all Bots from the Server.<br>
          NOTE that this will also set the min_bots &amp; max_bots settings from 
          the podbot.cfg to zero, so you have to add Bots manually if you want 
          them back in your game. Of course you can always use &quot;kick&quot; 
          to remove single bots. To manually change maps, use the substitution<br>
          for the map command. Type &quot;<b>newmap mapname</b>&quot; to change 
          to another map. So for example<br>
          to load &quot;DE_DUST&quot; you type &quot;newmap DE_DUST&quot;. Bots 
          present will join the Game<br>
          if the map is loaded. For all console commands please read the summary 
          below...<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Summary of Console Commands:</b><br>
        </p>
        <p>Most of the time you will only need the <b>POD-Bot User Menu</b> which 
          is by default bound to the &quot;=&quot; key. You can change this easily 
          with any text-editor in <b>'podbot.cfg</b>'. All commands in square 
          [] brackets are optional and don't need to be specified. Most of these 
          commands will also work in podbot.cfg. Again, PLEASE TAKE A LOOK INTO 
          THE FILE &quot;podbot.cfg&quot; !</p>
        <p><b>addbot [skill] [team] [name]</b></p>
        <p>Adds a new Bot with skill (0-100) to team (0-1 or use 5 to auto-assign) 
          with the<br>
          specified name. If you don't use the name argument it will be filled 
          randomly<br>
          from &quot;<b>podbot\botnames.txt</b>&quot;. You can edit this file 
          to use other names !</p>
        <p><b>botchat on|off</b></p>
        <p>Turns chatting Bots on or off</p>
        <p><b>botsvotemap x</b></p>
        <p>Orders all dead Bots to vote for Map x, where x is a valid number<br>
          of a map in your mapcycle.</p>
        <p><b>imaborg on|off</b></p>
        <p>Let's the Bot AI take care about the (Host) Player. Doesn't work perfectly 
          yet, use with <br>
          caution !</p>
        <p><b>jasonmode on|off</b></p>
        <p>Turns on/off &quot;JasonMode&quot;. In this Mode, Bots are only allowed 
          to use<br>
          a Knife and they won't buy any weapons at all. Use this for example<br>
          in cs_estate or cs_office to have a scary blood-feast ! This is a<br>
          Fun Mode and not to be taken serious ! Kids, don't try this at<br>
          home :)</p>
        <p><b>killbots</b></p>
        <p>Does what it says.</p>
        <p><b>newmap mapname</b></p>
        <p>Substitution for the &quot;map&quot; command you're used to. Loads 
          a new map.<br>
          This will work 100% with Bots and no client shouldl get disconnected.</p>
        <p><b>podbotmenu</b></p>
        <p>Displays the User-Menu by default bound to the &quot;=&quot; key.</p>
        <p><b>removebots</b></p>
        <p>Kicks all Bots of the Server. Note that this also changes the<br>
          min_bots and max_bots variables to 0.</p>
        <p><b>wptfolder foldername</b></p>
        <p>Specifies the Folder for loading waypoints. No special chars like<br>
          Spaces or quotation marks are allowed. Also note that the Folder<br>
          must be inside the Podbot Directory and thus the name ONLY consists 
          of the folder name.</p>
        <p><i>There are also some additional Fun-Modes which can be activated 
          with these commands:</i></p>
        <p><b>omg imonmars</b></p>
        <p>Halfs the normal CS Gravity, meaning you can jump a lot higher than 
          normally and you don't get much damage when falling. Try this if you 
          like John Woo Movies !</p>
        <p><b>omg imhaunted</b></p>
        <p>Bots are a bit translucent, making them look like ghosts and they are 
          much harder to<br>
          detect.</p>
        <p><b>omg itstoodark</b></p>
        <p>Every Bot has a bright lightsource Aura. Quite useful on very dark 
          maps to spot Bots easier.</p>
        <p><b>omg itsnewyear</b></p>
        <p>Bots celebrate New Year ! :)</p>
        <p><b>omg tronisback</b></p>
        <p>Adds a shiny hull over each Player which reminded me of the old movie 
          &quot;Tron&quot;. T Bots are Red, CT Bots are blue.</p>
        <p><b>omg imstoned</b></p>
        <p>You don't want to know... ;)</p>
        <p><b>omg imsober</b></p>
        <p>Turns off all Fun-Modes.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b></p>
        <p>These Fun Modes weren't fully tested out by me and it might be that 
          this or that isn't working properly with them. They are just leftovers 
          of my HL Engine tests and were left in to give you (hopefully) a good 
          laugh. If something doesn't work with them I honestly don't care that 
          much. </p>
        <p><br>
          There are some more commands which are only used in<br>
          &quot;podbot\podbot.cfg&quot;. Please have a look there, too !</p>
        <p><br>
          A lot of additional console commands are only used for<br>
          waypointing. These are explained in a separate File called<br>
          <a href="waypointshowtodo.html">WaypointsHowToDo.html</a></p>
        <p></p>
        <h3><br>
          Running POD-Bot on Win32 Dedicated servers:<br>
        </h3>
        <p>Install POD-Bot as described above and create a game the way you normally 
          would.<br>
          When running a dedicated server the POD-Bot commands that are normally<br>
          available in the client console are disabled. To create a bot you<br>
          must set the CVAR &quot;pb&quot; to the command you desire.. To use 
          the &quot;pb&quot; CVAR you<br>
          would use one of the following commands on the dedicated server command 
          line...</p>
        <p>pb &quot;addbot&quot;<br>
          pb &quot;addbot 100 5&quot;<br>
          pb &quot;addbot 20 1 DumbAss&quot;</p>
        <p>In addition these commands are supported:<br>
          pb &quot;fillserver 5&quot; (Fills server with auto-assigned Bots)<br>
          pb &quot;fillserver 1&quot; (Fills server with Terrorist Bots)<br>
          pb &quot;fillserver 2&quot; (Fills server with Counter Bots) <br>
          pb &quot;removebots&quot; (Disconnects all Bots from the Game)<br>
          pb &quot;killbots&quot; (Kills all Bots in the current round)<br>
          pb &quot;newmap mapname&quot; (Changes the Map)</p>
        <p>When using the dedicated server, bot will also be automatically spawned 
          using<br>
          the podbot.cfg file. You can also use the min_bots/max_bots settings 
          or the<br>
          addbot command explained in that file.</p>
        <h3><br>
          Playing with the Bots:</h3>
        The Bots will automatically know the goals of the map. Counter might<br>
        go for hostages, Terrorists may want to plant the bomb. VIP Bots will<br>
        try to reach the Rescue Points. The goal selection is done dynamically 
        and will be affected by several factors like Personality, Health, Team-mates 
        near &amp; Items the Bot is carrying. The Bots will also try to support 
        team-mates and take cover when they think it's needed. 
        <p> <b>Ordering Bots through Radio Commands:</b></p>
        <p> You can use some of the Radio Commands to get more support from your 
          Bots.<br>
          The first is &quot;<b>Follow Me</b>&quot; which commands Bots in the 
          near to follow you.<br>
          You can specify the maximum of following Bots in the podbot.cfg File<br>
          (defaults to 3).<br>
          If a Bot is following you, you can use<br>
          &quot;Hold this Position&quot; to make a pause at that Place and look 
          around for<br>
          enemies. You can use &quot;Go,go,go!&quot; to stop him from following 
          you again.<br>
          Note that they won't follow you in 3 cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> They don't want to ! The Bots have their own will and they issue 
            a<br>
            &quot;Negative&quot; if they don't want to follow you.</li>
          <li> They don't see you.</li>
          <li> They see an enemy and engage the target.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Terrorist Bot carrying the C4 or picking it up, will also issue a<br>
          &quot;Follow Me&quot; sometimes to have some assistance with him. Note 
          that<br>
          they have problems following on ladders at the moment because the movement 
          is unwaypointed.<br>
          They also do some other Radio Commands like &quot;Need Backup&quot;,&quot;Enemy 
          down&quot;,<br>
          &quot;Enemy spotted&quot;,&quot;I'm in Position&quot; (to tell you he's 
          camping) but not very often, otherwise it would surely get on your nerves...</p>
        <p><b>Summary of Bot Reactions to Radio Commands:<br>
          </b> </p>
        <p><b>Follow me</b> - Forces Bots in the near to follow you</p>
        <p><b>Hold this Position</b> - Makes a Bot who's following you, stay awhile 
          at that position</p>
        <p><b>Taking Fire, need assistance</b> - Makes all living Bots (not engaged 
          in a Fight) run to<br>
          your position to assist you.</p>
        <p><b>Need Backup</b> - Basically the same as above, but limited to distance 
          and also the Bots<br>
          use it sometimes to get some support.</p>
        <p> <b>Storm the Front!</b> - Mighty command! Forces all Bots in the near 
          to rush in the<br>
          direction you're pointing to when using that command. Basically their 
          level of agression is increased so a pathetic frightened Bot could also 
          turn around and flee.</p>
        <p><b>Get in position...</b> - Bots in the near will try to take a covered 
          position and stay there until they either encounter an enemy, you order 
          them to leave, or they waited too long.</p>
        <p><b>Go,go,go</b> - If a Bot follows you, this commands stops him from 
          following. If there<br>
          are other Bots in the near, they will stop camping and going to roam 
          the<br>
          map again (normally used in combination with &quot;Get in position...&quot;)</p>
        <p><b>Team, Fall Back!</b> - Opposite of &quot;Storm the Front&quot;. 
          Increases Fear and decreases agression of Bots in the near so that they 
          are more likely to fall back and stay covered for a short period.<br>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Bot Skill differences:</b></p>
        <p> First, Bots with low skills will pause/camp longer and more often. 
          Bots<br>
          with low skills have a bigger surprise time and they shoot slower. Bots<br>
          with low skill are lucky if they hit something. Then there are minor<br>
          behaviour differences. For example Bots with a skill above 80 use the<br>
          knife more often if you're near them. If you want to get headshots all<br>
          the time (and really fast) add some Bots with a skill of 100.</p>
        <p>You can easily change a lot of skill parameters by editing the file<br>
          '<b>botskill.cfg</b>' with any text-editor. Also take a look into 'podbot.cfg'<br>
          to adjust some more things to your liking... <br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Bot Personalities:</b></p>
        <p>There are 3 different Personalities in POD now, if you have detailnames 
          turned on they can are shown through the Prefixes like this:<br>
          [P*D] - Agressive<br>
          [POD] - Normal<br>
          [P0D] - Defensive</p>
        <p>Right now the Personality is randomly chosen if a new Bot gets created. 
          I want to extend a lot of stuff around Personalities so there's no sense 
          in a specific selection and it can't be done. </p>
