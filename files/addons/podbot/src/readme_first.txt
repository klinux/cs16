POD-Bot Source released on 01/01/2003

Some notes about the source-code:

Unfortunately the sources aren't as cleaned up or new as I would like them to be.
It's over a year old and the internal version is something like v2.6 where I just
started to try out new things. I had a very much better newer version but I've lost it
due to a hd-crash and missing backup. So to sum it up it might not even run
properly with the latest CS and it could be very buggy.
However it might help some people working on their own bot or just to "borrow" some
code out of it (though I'd advise you not to do so). You're free to use it and
abuse it like you want. I've used Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 6.0 with the latest
Service Packs to work on these sources, never bothered to compile this with other
Compilers so I can't give you any help on this. If you're using VC++ then you
would have to change the hardcoded path in Settings/Custom Build to the path
your HL/CS is located (which will copy the compiled DLL into the Podbot folder).

I've also included some of Botman's tutorials on Bot Building and HL Mechanics with
this to help you on your quest.

My email addresses change a lot so it wouldn't be a good idea to write it down here.
If you need help regarding this source I'd think it might be a good idea to post
in the developer forum at http://forums.nuclearbox.com/
For general HL Bot developing questions and ideas Botman's developer forum at
http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~botman/yabb/YaBB.pl became quite a standard
(please don't ask about POD-Bot code here)
